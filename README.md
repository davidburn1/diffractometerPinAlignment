# diffractometerPinAlignment

Align a pin on the center of a diffractometer by rotating the diffractometer axes whilst taking images. 

Image recognition is used to locate the position of the pin and find the corresponding motor positions where the pin is at the center.

A report is also included for the RASOR diffractometer at Diamond showing the sphere of confusion and coupling between axes

Uses python for analysis and image recognition. Epics drivers to controll the motors and collect images from cameras.
